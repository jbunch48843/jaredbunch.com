                <p>When I joined this project, the team was already moving fast.

                <p>The user engagement plan would show how we would talk to customers and test our ideas. This helped the engineering team see that design was there to help them win.</p>

    <div class="text-xl text-slate-600 space-y-8 max-w-2xl">
        <p>This project taught me a lot about leading from within a team that was already moving fast. I learned that even when you join late, good design can still make a massive difference.</p>
        
        <p>While the results show that people are using the new tools, I know that command usage doesn't always mean a customer is happy. We have since started a new initiative to measure actual satisfaction, but to truly understand the full life of a document, we still need to make deeper changes to how the software is built.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">Bridging the trust gap</h3>
        <p>The biggest hurdle was a gap between what the business wanted to build and what the customers were actually ready for. My research showed that users didn't trust the automation to do the job perfectly yet. They weren't ready for a "black box" solution.</p>
        
        <p>I worked with the product manager on a plan to roll the features out in stages. The goal was to build trust by showing users how the individual automations worked before giving them a single, push button solution.</p>

        <p>When I presented this to the stakeholders, there were a lot of different opinions. In the end, the leadership decided to stick with the original plan. We took a "disagree and commit" approach, and I focused on helping the team deliver the first version to our customers on time. It was a great reminder that my role is to provide the evidence and a clear path forward, even if the final decision goes in a different direction.</p>
